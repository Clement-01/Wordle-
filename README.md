# Wordle

This project is a replica of the New York Times word game. 
In this game, players have a given number of attempts to guess a word which the system has randomly chosen from a list of words.
After guessing a word, the colors of the letters change depending on the correctness of the guess.

A letter colored green means that the letter exists in the word and is in the right position.
A letter colored yellow means that the letter exists in the word but has not been placed at the right position.
A letter colored red means that the letter does not exist in the word.
